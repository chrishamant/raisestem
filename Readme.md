# Raise STEM!

## Prime Motivator

Our mission is to foster the growth of an innovative spirit within our community by promoting educational initiatives that build foundations in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM).
Our hope is to build a collaborative network of individuals and institutions across the community through a variety of educational programs and ongoing workshops.
The intent isn't to focus solely on STEM but a broader interdiscinplinary synthesis of the creative arts and sciences.
Someday we hope for the work done by Raise STEM! to provide national recognition to the Dayton Metro and surrounding areas as a center for innovative expression - bridging the gap between the arts, sciences, and technology.

## The Road Ahead

### Phase 1 - Impacting The Future 
As many of the members of Raise STEM! are existing coaches and mentors in the internationally renowned _First_&trade; family of programs, we know how much these programs can make an impact with kids already interested in STEM.
We want to expand upon the groundwork laid by _First_ and support existing teams already in the area while looking for opportunities and individuals to foster the creation of new teams in any/all tiers of the _First_ programs.
By supporting these teams as they seek to establish themselves around the Miami Valley we believe Raise STEM! can play a valuable role in the promotion of STEM education in the near term.

### Phase 2 - Making It Real
As our network of teams grows we plan to provide facilities and services to aid in our network's continued expansion.
The goal is to provide a top-down makerspace that provides access to machine shop facilities and other necessary tools.
We hope is to support the existence of FLL practice fields and some space for _First_ teams to collaborate on- and off-season.
As we expand our facilities we hope to partner with community arts, business and marketing organizations to make these spaces and workshops a beacon of energetic and creative energy in the region.

### Phase 3 - Doubling Down on the Future
As our pilot center and facilities become operational, our plans are to try and copy and paste the successes we've made to expand the sphere of influence of our loose network of partnerships we've garnered over time.
Continually improving our offerings only helps to further establish Raise STEM! within the community.
In the near future, we hope to be in place where we can more concretely strengthen the connections to community and a wider public through continued outreach and membership.
We hope to form partner spaces throughout the community to further our mission.
These partner spaces will incorporate other art studios, as well as wood shops, machine shops, and spaces for welding, soldering, electrical, sewing, stained glass, blacksmithing, and other media as the partnership grows.
The resulting network will tie the business, legal, and funding resources to enable innovative and creative ideas to come forward and flourish across the Miami Valley and beyond.
